									Breast: These are white meat and are relatively dry. The breast has two segments which are sold together on bone-in breasts, but separated on boneless breasts:
									<ol>
										<li>
											The "breast", when sold as boneless, and
										</li>
										<li>
											two "tenderloin", located on each side between the breast meat and the ribs. These are removed from boneless breasts and sold separately as tenderloins.
										</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>
									Leg: Comprises two segments:
									<ol>
										<li>
											The "drumstick"; this is dark meat and is the lower part of the leg,
										</li>
										<li>the "thigh"; also dark meat, this is the upper part of the leg.
										</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>
									Wing: Often served as a light meal or bar food. Buffalo wings are a typical example. Comprises three segments:
									<ol>
										<li>the "drumette", shaped like a small drumstick, this is white meat,
										</li>
										<li> the middle "flat" segment, containing two bones, and   </li>
										<li>the tip, often discarded.</li>

										Chicken feet: These contain relatively little meat, and are eaten mainly for the skin and cartilage. Although considered exotic in Western cuisine, the feet are common fare in other cuisines, especially in the Caribbean, China and Vietnam.
									</li>
									<li>
										Giblets: organs such as the heart, gizzards, and liver may be included inside a butchered chicken or sold separately.
									</li>
									<li>
										Head: Considered a delicacy in China, the head is split down the middle, and the brains and other tissue is eaten.
									</li>
									<li>
										Kidneys: Normally left in when a broiler carcass is processed, they are found in deep pockets on each side of the vertebral column.
									</li>
									<li>
										Neck: This is served in various Asian dishes. It is stuffed to make helzel among Ashkenazi Jews.
									</li>
									<li>
										Oysters: Located on the back, near the thigh, these small, round pieces of dark meat are often considered to be a delicacy.
									</li>
									<li>
										Pygostyle (chicken's buttocks) and testicles: These are commonly eaten in East Asia and some parts of South East Asia.

										Blood: Immediately after slaughter, blood may be drained into a receptacle, which is then used in various products. In many Asian countries, the blood is poured into low, cylindrical forms, and left to congeal into disc-like cakes for sale. These are commonly cut into cubes, and used in soup dishes.Carcass: After the removal of the flesh, this is used for soup stock.Chicken eggs: The most well-known and well-consumed byproduct.

										Heart and gizzard: in Brazilian churrascos, chicken hearts are an often seen as a delicacy.
										Liver: This is the largest organ of the chicken, and is used in such dishes as Pâté and chopped liver.Schmaltz: This is produced by rendering the fat, and is used in various dishes.

					<span>Use of Roxarsone in chicken production</span>
					<br>In factory farming, chickens are routinely administered with the feed additive Roxarsone, an organoarsenic compound which partially decomposes into inorganic arsenic compounded in the flesh of chickens, and in their feces, which are often used as a fertilizer. The compound is used to control stomach pathogens and promote growth. In a 2013 sample conducted by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health of chicken meat from poultry producers that did not prohibit roxarsone, 70% of the samples in the US had levels which exceeded the safety limits as set by the FDA. The FDA has since revised its stance on safe limits to inorganic arsenic in animal feed by stating that "any new animal drug that contributes to the overall inorganic arsenic burden is of potential concern".<br>

					<span>Antibiotic resistance</span>
					<br>Information obtained by the Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance (CIPARS) "strongly indicates that cephalosporin resistance in humans is moving in lockstep with the use of the drug in poultry production". According to the Canadian Medical Association Journal, the unapproved antibiotic ceftiofur is routinely injected into eggs in Quebec and Ontario to discourage infection of hatchlings. Although the data are contested by the industry, antibiotic resistance in humans appears to be directly related to the antibiotic's use in eggs.

					A recent study by the Translational Genomics Research Institute showed that nearly half (47%) of the meat and poultry in US grocery stores was contaminated with S. aureus, with more than half (52%) of those bacteria resistant to antibiotics. Furthermore, as per the FDA, more than 25% of retail chicken is resistant to 5 or more different classes of antibiotic treatment drugs in the United States. An estimated 90–100% of conventional chicken contains, at least, one form of antibiotic resistance microorganism, while organic chicken has been found to have a lower incidence at 84%.

					<span>Marketing and sales</span>
					<br>Chicken is sold both as whole birds and broken down into pieces. Worldwide, there are many fast food restaurant chains that sell exclusively or primarily poultry products including KFC (global), Red Rooster (Australia), Hector Chicken (Belgium) and CFC (Indonesia). Most of the products on the menus in such eateries are fried or breaded and are served with french fries.
					<br>In the United Kingdom, juvenile chickens of less than 28 days of age at slaughter are marketed as poussin. Mature chicken is sold as small, medium or large.
					<br>In the United States, whole mature chickens are marketed as fryers, broilers, and roasters. Fryers are the smallest size (2.5-4 lbs dressed for sale), and the most common, as chicken reach this size quickly (about 7 weeks). Broilers are larger than fryers. Roasters, or roasting hens, are the largest chickens commonly sold (3–5 months and 6-8 lbs) and are typically more expensive. Even larger and older chickens are called stewing chickens but these are no longer usually found commercially. The names reflect the most appropriate cooking method for the surface area to volume ratio. As the size increases, the volume (which determines how much heat must enter the bird for it to be cooked) increases faster than the surface area (which determines how fast heat can enter the bird). For a fast method of cooking, such as frying, a small bird is appropriate: frying a large piece of chicken results in the inside being undercooked when the outside is ready.
					<br>Chicken is also sold broken down into pieces. Such pieces usually come from smaller birds that would qualify as fryers if sold whole. Pieces may include quarters, or fourths of the chicken. A chicken is typically cut into two leg quarters and two breast quarters. Each quarter contains two of the commonly available pieces of chicken. A leg quarter contains the thigh, drumstick and a portion of the back; a leg has the back portion removed. A breast quarter contains the breast, wing and portion of the back; a breast has the back portion and wing removed. Pieces may be sold in packages of all of the same pieces, or in combination packages. Whole chicken cut up refers to either the entire bird cut into 8 individual pieces. (8-piece cut); or sometimes without the back. A 9-piece cut (usually for fast food restaurants) has the tip of the breast cut off before splitting. Pick of the chicken, or similar titles, refers to a package with only some of the chicken pieces, typically the breasts, thighs, and legs without wings or back. Thighs and breasts are sold boneless or skinless. Chicken livers and gizzards are commonly available packaged separately. Other parts of the chicken, such as the neck, feet, combs, etc. are not widely available except in countries where they are in demand, or in cities that cater to ethnic groups who favor these parts.
